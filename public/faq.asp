   <H3>Questions people ask</H3>
   <p>Do I really need a life coach?<br /><span class="Quote">
   That depends on how serious you are about changing your life.
      Coaching is not about someone else telling you what you should do; it is about helping
      you become more aware of who you really are and how to become the person you want
      to be.&nbsp; Many people know what they want, and with a little help and reflection
      even know how to accomplish it, but what they need is someone who will listen, challenge
      and encourage them, so that they have the motivation to reach their goal.</span></p>
   <p>How are coaching sessions organised?<br />
   <span class="Quote">
   Almost all coaching are conducted over the phone, with the client 
   calling the coach at a pre-arranged time, for a session lasting up
   to 45 minutes. Although some clients think that they would prefer a 
   face to face encounter, the majority discover that a conversation over 
   the phone enables them to be less self conscious and therefore more 
   honest and open. Without a willingness to really understand oneself 
   and face issues, the dramatic life changes that coaching offers are more
   difficult to achieve.&nbsp; However, face to face sessions can be 
   arranged where appropriate.</span></p>
   <p>How many sessions do I need?<br />
   <span class="Quote">Many people come to coaching because they have a particularly
   pressing goal or situation that they want to change, and for some a couple of sessions
   is all that is required to help them get their own thinking straight, usually because
   they have been going over the issue for months beforehand.&nbsp; Although the results
   of even a single session can be beneficial, it is often superficial as it takes a couple
   of sessions for trust in the coaching relationship to develop, and for the client
   to have to confidence to really share their dreams and values. Only then are they 
   willing to confront the areas of their life that that are holding them back. </span>
