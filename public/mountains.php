   <H3>What are the mountains in your life?</H3>
   <P>We are all very good at making mountains out of mole hills.</P>
   <P>There are ...</P>
   <UL>
      <LI>things we planned to do in life</LI>
      <LI>situations we want to change</LI>
      <LI>tasks we need to complete</LI>
      <LI>relationships to improve</LI>
      <LI>stress to be relieved</LI>
      <LI>peace to be found</LI>
   </UL><p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but the prospect of actually
   attaining our dreams just seems too daunting.</p>
   <P>Whether the mountains in your life are real or imaginary, a session with 
   a profession life coach at LIFESPEAK, will help you reach the
   peak that you have been dreaming of.</P>
   <P>It is your life and your mountain, therefore we will not presume to tell 
   you what you can or can't do, nor how to go about it. 
   This brand of life coaching is entirely non-directive;
   which means that we believe that you have all the answers. All you need is
   for someone to give your their full attention and with skilful use of
   listening, questions and silence to help you see for yourself that you have
   the solution and the motivation. To reach your peak, the only way is up.</P><!--
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   <P>What is it that you are afraid of?</P>
   <P>Have you lost your way in your struggle to reach the top?</P>
   <P>Does your fear or low self esteem prevent you from reaching the heights
   you have dreamed of.</P>
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   <P>&nbsp;</P>-->

      If on the other hand the mountains you want to climb are of the physical
      variety and what you are looking for is an experienced mountain leader to
      give you confidence, we could be of assistance there also. 
      Give us a call and ask about LIFESPEAK Climbing.
