   <H3>What is life coaching?</H3>
   <p>Life coaching is a rapidly emerging new profession, that has already 
   been embraced both by businesses and individuals who recognise that they 
   need assistance, to improve their performance and reach their goals.</p>
   <p>As with many sports coaches, a life coach is not a counsellor, or even 
   a mentor, but rather a professional who has the skills and patience to 
   really get to know the player, and enable them to realise their true 
   potential.</P>
   <p>The sort of people who seek out a life coach, usually already have a 
   clear idea of what is either missing in their life, or the area that they 
   want to improve. What they need is someone to come along side, to help them
   evaluate their options and overcome obstacles; then to support and encourage
   them as they make the personal changes necessary to see their dreams 
   fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Good coaches do not provide solutions, and usually avoid giving advice, 
   because they believe that the client is far more likely to succeed, by 
   taking actions that they come up with themselves. The role of a life 
   coach is therefore to facilitate awareness and confidence, liberating the 
   individual from the blockages, fears and false beliefs that have held 
   them back in the past.</p>
   <p>
   Your life coach will be a good listener, committed to helping you resolve your issues,
   clarify your values and motivate you to reach your goals. This is a partnership
   of mutual trust. </p>
   <p>Everything you share will be treated with respect and absolute
   confidence. There is not fixed agenda or predefined result. What you get out of
   coaching will depend on who you discover yourself to be and how committed you are
   to realise your dreams.
