	<li>PRIVACY OF DATA SUPPLIED BY YOU</li>
	<ol>
	   <li>Lifespeak Ltd are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. 
	      If you register as a client with Lifespeak Ltd, Lifespeak Ltd may need to 
	      obtain some personal information about you, which is stored on Lifespeak 
	      Ltd&#146;s computer. Lifespeak Ltd may need to know your name, address, 
	      e-mail address, and telephone number.
	   </li>
	   <li>In addition to the above, the personal information which you provide 
	      us with, together with information on services that you have ordered from 
	      us in the past may be used by Lifespeak Ltd, for the purpose of notifying 
	      you about any special offers or features which may be of interest to you 
	      and for related marketing purposes. If you would rather not receive this 
	      material, you will be given an opportunity to notify us accordingly before 
	      submitting your personal information. Otherwise, by submitting your 
	      information you consent to its use in this way.
	   </li>
	   <li>If Lifespeak Ltd changes its terms and conditions of use, Lifespeak Ltd 
	      will post the changes on this page so that you may be aware of them and 
	      you will be given a chance to ask Lifespeak Ltd not to use your information 
	      for the changed purposes.
	   </li>
	   <li>Because the Internet infrastructure is global, and it is not possible 
	      to predict the routes that information sent over the Internet will take, 
	      the information you provide may be transferred temporarily via a route 
	      which takes it outside the European Economic Area as it passes between you 
	      and us. By submitting your information you consent to this transfer.
	    </li>
	 </ol>
	 <li>HOW LIFESPEAK PROTECTS INFORMATION WHICH IT HOLDS ABOUT YOU</li>
	 <p>The Internet is not a secure medium. However, Lifespeak Ltd will use 
	    its reasonable endeavours to keep the personal information it receives about 
	    you confidential. Lifespeak Ltd uses your information only as set out in 
	    these terms and conditions and save as otherwise provided hereunder will not 
	    sell or pass your information on to any third parties for marketing purposes 
	    without first obtaining your consent.</p>
	 <li>LOSSES RESULTING FROM UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO YOUR DATA</li>
	 <p>You accept the risk that data transmitted electronically 
	    via the website or otherwise may be intercepted before reaching its intended 
	    destination or accessed by unauthorised third parties and may be exploited 
	    unlawfully by such third parties. Lifespeak Ltd does not assume responsibility for 
	    guarding against the acts of such third parties and shall not be liable for 
	    any direct, indirect, consequential, special or other damage resulting from 
	    third parties&#146; interception of or access to data of whatever 
	    nature.
	 </p>
	 <li>EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY</li>
	 <p>Lifespeak Ltd excludes all liability it may have to you to the 
	    fullest extent permitted by law (and whether such liability arises in 
	    contract, tort or otherwise) as a result of your use of this website or your 
	    accepting of a job vacancy through the website. Nothing in these terms and 
	    conditions shall exclude Lifespeak Ltd&#146;s liability for death or personal injury due to 
	    its negligence or for fraudulent misrepresentation.
	 </p>
	 <li>GOVERNING LAW</li>
	 <p>If not actually the case, the contract under which you use 
	    this website shall be deemed to have been made in England and the 
	    construction, validity and performance of these terms and conditions of use 
	    shall be governed in all respects by English law and the English courts shall 
	    have non-exclusive jurisdiction in respect of any dispute between you and Lifespeak Ltd 
	    concerning your use of this website.
