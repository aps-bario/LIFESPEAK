   <H3>An investment in yourself</H3>
   <p>
      How much a person is prepared to invest in their own personal growth and development
      varies according to how determined they are, that they want to change the parts
      of their life that they are not happy with.
   </p>
      <p>
         If you want your home to be warm and comfortable, 
   but discover that your central heating isn't working, what would you 
   to pay someone to get the problem sorted?</p>
<p>
   If your have ambition, but your current job is neither fulfilling 
   or meeting your needs, how much would you be prepared to invest in 
   your future?
</p>
<p>
   Life coaching is not a quick fix or a shoulder to cry on, it is for people who have
   a fairly good idea of what needs to change in their life for them to feel fulfilled
   and happy.&nbsp; It is for people who are prepared to embark on an adventure of
   self-discovery and need a partner to support and encourage them through the ups
   and downs as they press on to the goal they have set themselves.
</p>
<p>
   Therefore, although some people find that a single 45 minute session, 
   is sufficient to give them the clarity they need for a particularly 
   pressing issue; most find it more beneficial to have a series of 
   weekly sessions lasting a couple of months. This allows them to look at 
   several aspects of their life and to develop new ways of thinking and 
   acting that will bring lasting results.
